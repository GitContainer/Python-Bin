<h4>Python-Bin</h4>

Python Bin - my pythonpath functions</p>

<h6>inout.py</h6>
File contains few functions I am using to control input and output of my python scripts. "inout.py" should be located in python path. </p>
Most of the fuctions are called by: </p>
message/description - text displayed to the user </p>
default - default numeric value </p>

<h6>fromtostep.py</h6>
Modification of range (python) and arange (numpy) functions to ressemble from-to-step commands, as used in basic, once upon the time. Two functions returning float or integer, no matter what input is, created. I'm doing strange calcs, sometimes.</p>
Refer to file "test.py" for usage hint.</p>
Feel free to modify as you see fits.</p>

<h6>trigd.py</h6>
Trigonometric functions in degrees, instead in radians. Time saver, only. </p>
